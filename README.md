## Formatting

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [hosted on GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Friendly Tip for LAMP stack devs: You don't need to know anything about Ruby to use Jekyll.

## Local testing

If you would like to try viewing this locally.
You can run the command `test_site_locally.bash`.

This will run an instance of jekyll inside a docker container and expose it on
<http://localhost:4000>.

### Prerequisites

To use the local testing script you will need to have installed Docker.
[See the Docker Installation Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
And make sure to add your user to the `docker` group.
